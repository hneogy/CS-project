Hi! I’m Caroline Monsini, a student at Bentley University, graduating in 2028. I’m passionate about writing and music—especially songwriting—as well as entrepreneurship and creating meaningful connections with others. I love expressing myself creatively, finding ways to inspire people, and making a positive impact wherever I go.
